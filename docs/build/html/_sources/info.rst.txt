Welcome to Beacon's documentation!
====================================

The Beacon is a Python library which was developed within the scope of a bachelor thesis. The software was created to design and implement an extended version of the GA4GH Beacon protocol to include more data information to increase usability, but without sacrificing privacy. The software could be integrated in the VarFish software, which is a management and research tool for genetic variant data.
Have fun exploring this version!
